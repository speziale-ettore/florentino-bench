florentino-bench -- Florentino's benchmarks
===========================================

During my stay at BSC I had to play with some benchmarks. Unfortunately, they
were not organized in an unique framework. This project contains these
benchmarks, organized in a consistent framework. The project name is derived
from the guy who initially gives me the benchmarks.

I, [Ettore Speziale](mailto:speziale.ettore@gmail.com), did not write any
benchmark. I simple started from the version Florentino Sainz gives me and I
did some refactoring, and improved some parts of them.
